This is one of many shiny apps dedicated to and inspired by **Emelie**! The app is part of the JAEG collection of visualization and reporting showcase.

The app calculates the margin of errors for proportion and mean, with or without correction for population size (i.e., finite population correction).

The app main feature is the use of dynamic graphics to visualize how errors change as your sample size and desired margin of errors change.

The app is made possible using various R packages - `shiny`, `Shinydashboard`, and `ggplot2`.
